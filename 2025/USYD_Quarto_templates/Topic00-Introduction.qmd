# What is a statistician?

-   A primary objective of the statistician is to answer a research question. Most of the time, the research question concerns with activities/behaviours/phenomena in a targeted **population**.

-   Measurements with respect to the population is always very difficult to obtain, so statisticians aim to answer the research question using a **sample**.

-   A majority of the statistics literature looks at how to ‘best’ infer population characteristics from a sample.

Example: what is the proportion of Australians who are taller than 180
cm?


-   **Solution 1:** Survey all Australians (the population) and
    calculate the proportion.

-   **Solution 2:** Measure the heights of a subset of the population.
    Build a model based on the observed heights and then answer the
    question using the model.

## Population and sample

-   The target population comprises all relevant subjects of interest.

-   The sample is a manageable subset, selected to make the study
    feasible.

\newpage

# Population and sample

-   A sample is a subset of the population.
-   It should be representative of the target population (not
    **biased**).
-   Large enough to give accurate information about the population.
-   Ideally, the observations should be independent of each other.

![](images/img2.png){fig-align="center"}

# Sources of bias

Bias may be defined as any systematic error (ie. not occurring randomly)
which results in incorrect conclusions about the target population. Some
types of bias include

-   Selection bias
-   Measurement bias
-   Response bias
-   Confounding

\newpage

## Selection bias

Selection bias refers to any systematic differences occurring in the way
that subjects are selected for a study.

![](figure/basketball.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.callout-note}

E.g. In a height study, we accidentally selected a group of basketball
players.

:::

\newpage

## Measurement bias

Measurement bias refers to systematic differences in the measurement of
variables.

![](figure/temperature.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.callout-note}
E.g. In a human body temperature study, an in-ear thermometer is
consistently higher than that of an oral thermometer.
:::

## Response bias

-   Response bias can occur when the response rate to a survey is too
    low.

-   This is because those who respond to a survey often have different
    characteristics or attitudes than those who don’t respond.

-   This is most common when sensitive issues are involved.

\newpage

## Confounding

Confounding occurs when the effect of one variable (X) on another
variable (Y) is clouded by the influence of another variable (Z).

![](figure/confounding.png){fig-align="center"}

E.g., X: increase in ice cream sales, Y: increase in drowning incidents;
Z: sunny and warm weather

::: {.callout-important}
Confounders can be hard to find, and can mislead about a cause and effect relationship.

# Study design

There are two main types of study designs

An **observational study** is one in which there is no treatment imposed
by the investigator.

-   We simply observe.

-   Data are observed and recorded based on responses from subjects.

An **experimental study** is one in which the investigator has some
control over the subjects by giving some kind of treatment.

-   Explanatory variable (determinant) is perturbed, behaviour of
    dependent variable (response) is noted.

-   Data are observed and recorded based on responses from subjects.

## Study design

Conclusions of a study depends on the design. Roughly speaking:

**Observational studies** allow us to infer **association**.

-   We should be very careful about the implications: **association** is
    not **causation**

-   Confounding variables are always a possible cause of ridiculous
    conclusions.
    
::: callout-example
- E.g. 3 glasses of water can cure flu. Problem: I take my flu medicine with a glass of water, 3 times day.
:::

**Experimental studies** allow us to infer causation.

-   Usually more informative on the underlying mechanisms, since the
    researchers can eliminate external factors in their experiments.

- One must be very familiar with experimental designs and take into account of all sources of variations.

::: callout-example
- E.g. Crops growth is better in soil with high nitrogen and locations with good sunlight. If an experiment only contains high nitrogen soil and good sunlight, then it is not possible to separate out these two effects.

## Example: does smoking cause liver cancer?

A study finds that smokers tend to have higher rates of liver cancer.
Does smoking cause liver cancer?

# Association and causation

It is rather easy to establish association (that one thing is linked to
another).

-   Association may **suggest** causation. But association does not
    **prove** causation.
-   We need to take **confounding** variables into account. They can
    mislead about a cause and effect relationship.

What could explain the fact that smokers have a higher rate of liver
cancer?

-   Smokers tend to drink more alcohol than non-smokers, and excessive
    alcohol consumption causes liver cancer.
-   So the effect of smoking is confounded (mixed-up) with the effect of
    alcohol consumption.
-   Here alcohol consumption is a confounding factor.

## Strategy for establishing causation

-   If a confounder is known, we can potentially add it as an additional
    variable. For example, if alcohol consumption is a potential
    confounding factor for smoking's effect on liver cancer, we can add
    an variable "drinking" with possible values:
    -   "heavy drinker", "medium drinker", "light drinker", "lifetime
        abstainer"

-   In some scenarios, for example, in clinical trials, it is possible
    to design [**controlled experimental studies**]{.pwd} by
    manipulating variables to test their effects.

# Extra Example

## Investigating Speed Limit 

Speed Limit could be considered as a discrete, quantitative variable, but here it might be better to classify it as an (ordinal) qualitative variable. Why?

```{r, dpi=50}
data = read.csv("data/2020fatalities.csv", header=TRUE)
SpeedLimit = data$Speed.Limit
Dayweek = data$Dayweek
Gender = data$Gender
table(SpeedLimit)  
```

\newpage

## Simple Bar Plot
```{r}
barplot(table(SpeedLimit))  
```

## Statistical Thinking

What is curious about this data? Why?

- -9 indicates a missing value. Why speed category of <40 **and**  speed limits of 10,15,20,25,30? We could 'clean' the data.

What was the most common speed at which a road fatality occurred? How might this affect public policy?

- Notice how many fatalities happen at high speeds (100km/hr+).  

- Can we directly deduce from that lives can be saved by introducing stricter speed limits?

\newpage

## Clean data 
```{r}
SpeedLimit[SpeedLimit=="5"] = "<40"
SpeedLimit[SpeedLimit=="10"] = "<40"
SpeedLimit[SpeedLimit=="15"] = "<40"
SpeedLimit[SpeedLimit=="20"] = "<40"
SpeedLimit[SpeedLimit=="25"] = "<40"
SpeedLimit[SpeedLimit=="30"] = "<40"
SpeedLimit[SpeedLimit==-9] = NA

SpeedLimit = factor(SpeedLimit, levels=c("<40","40", "50", "60", "70", "75",
                                         "80", "90","100","110","130"))
```

## New barplot of SpeedLimit

```{r}
barplot(table(SpeedLimit))  
```


## Double Bar Plot
```{r}
#Gender = data$Gender
data2 = table(Gender,SpeedLimit)
barplot(data2[-c(1,4),], main="Fatalities by Speed Limit and Gender",
  xlab="Speed Limit", col=c("lightblue","lightgreen"),
 	legend = rownames(data2[-c(1,4),]), beside=TRUE)
```

## Statistical Thinking

Are there any interesting patterns?
