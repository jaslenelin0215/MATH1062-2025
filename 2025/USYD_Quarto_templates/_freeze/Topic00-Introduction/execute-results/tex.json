Most of the time, the research question concerns with activities/behaviours/phenomena in a targeted **population**.\n\n-   Measurements with respect to the population is always very difficult to obtain, so statisticians aim to answer the research question using a **sample**.\n\n-   A majority of the statistics literature looks at how to ‘best’ infer population characteristics from a sample.\n\nExample: what is the proportion of Australians who are taller than 180\ncm?\n\n\n-   **Solution 1:** Survey all Australians (the population) and\n    calculate the proportion.\n\n-   **Solution 2:** Measure the heights of a subset of the population.\n    Build a model based on the observed heights and then answer the\n    question using the model.\n\n::::\n\n\n# Course overview\n\n-   Fundamental statistical concepts.\n-   A number of useful statistical models.\n-   Probability and sampling.\n-   Decision with data.\n-   The R computing language -- for all computational aspects and report\n    written in the course.\n    \n![](images/img1.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# Plan for lectures 1 -- 4\n\n-   Critical thinking with data\n-   Initial data analysis\n-   Graphical summaries\n-   Numerical summaries\n\n\n## Population and sample\n\n-   The target population comprises all relevant subjects of interest.\n\n-   The sample is a manageable subset, selected to make the study\n    feasible.\n\n![](images/img2.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\\newpage\n\n# Population and sample\n\n-   A sample is a subset of the population.\n-   It should be representative of the target population (not\n    **biased**).\n-   Large enough to give accurate information about the population.\n-   Ideally, the observations should be independent of each other.\n\n![](images/img2.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# Sources of bias\n\nBias may be defined as any systematic error (ie. not occurring randomly)\nwhich results in incorrect conclusions about the target population. Some\ntypes of bias include\n\n-   Selection bias\n-   Measurement bias\n-   Response bias\n-   Confounding\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Selection bias\n\nSelection bias refers to any systematic differences occurring in the way\nthat subjects are selected for a study.\n\n![](figure/basketball.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\nE.g. In a height study, we accidentally selected a group of basketball\nplayers.\n\n:::\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Measurement bias\n\nMeasurement bias refers to systematic differences in the measurement of\nvariables.\n\n![](figure/temperature.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nE.g. In a human body temperature study, an in-ear thermometer is\nconsistently higher than that of an oral thermometer.\n:::\n\n## Response bias\n\n-   Response bias can occur when the response rate to a survey is too\n    low.\n\n-   This is because those who respond to a survey often have different\n    characteristics or attitudes than those who don’t respond.\n\n-   This is most common when sensitive issues are involved.\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Confounding\n\nConfounding occurs when the effect of one variable (X) on another\nvariable (Y) is clouded by the influence of another variable (Z).\n\n![](figure/confounding.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nE.g., X: increase in ice cream sales, Y: increase in drowning incidents;\nZ: sunny and warm weather\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nConfounders can be hard to find, and can mislead about a cause and effect relationship.\n:::\n\n# Study design\n\nThere are two main types of study designs\n\nAn **observational study** is one in which there is no treatment imposed\nby the investigator.\n\n-   We simply observe.\n\n-   Data are observed and recorded based on responses from subjects.\n\nAn **experimental study** is one in which the investigator has some\ncontrol over the subjects by giving some kind of treatment.\n\n-   Explanatory variable (determinant) is perturbed, behaviour of\n    dependent variable (response) is noted.\n\n-   Data are observed and recorded based on responses from subjects.\n\n## Study design\n\nConclusions of a study depends on the design. Roughly speaking:\n\n**Observational studies** allow us to infer **association**.\n\n-   We should be very careful about the implications: **association** is\n    not **causation**\n\n-   Confounding variables are always a possible cause of ridiculous\n    conclusions.\n    \n::: callout-example\n- E.g. 3 glasses of water can cure flu. Problem: I take my flu medicine with a glass of water, 3 times day.\n:::\n\n**Experimental studies** allow us to infer causation.\n\n-   Usually more informative on the underlying mechanisms, since the\n    researchers can eliminate external factors in their experiments.\n\n- One must be very familiar with experimental designs and take into account of all sources of variations.\n\n::: callout-example\n- E.g. Crops growth is better in soil with high nitrogen and locations with good sunlight. If an experiment only contains high nitrogen soil and good sunlight, then it is not possible to separate out these two effects.\n:::\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Example: does smoking cause liver cancer?\n\nA study finds that smokers tend to have higher rates of liver cancer.\nDoes smoking cause liver cancer?\n\n![](figure/livercancer.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\\newpage\n\n# Association and causation\n\nIt is rather easy to establish association (that one thing is linked to\nanother).\n\n-   Association may **suggest** causation. But association does not\n    **prove** causation.\n-   We need to take **confounding** variables into account. They can\n    mislead about a cause and effect relationship.\n\nWhat could explain the fact that smokers have a higher rate of liver\ncancer?\n\n-   Smokers tend to drink more alcohol than non-smokers, and excessive\n    alcohol consumption causes liver cancer.\n-   So the effect of smoking is confounded (mixed-up) with the effect of\n    alcohol consumption.\n-   Here alcohol consumption is a confounding factor.\n\n## Strategy for establishing causation\n\n-   If a confounder is known, we can potentially add it as an additional\n    variable. For example, if alcohol consumption is a potential\n    confounding factor for smoking's effect on liver cancer, we can add\n    an variable \"drinking\" with possible values:\n    -   \"heavy drinker\", \"medium drinker\", \"light drinker\", \"lifetime\n        abstainer\"\n\n-   In some scenarios, for example, in clinical trials, it is possible\n    to design [**controlled experimental studies**]{.pwd} by\n    manipulating variables to test their effects.\n\n:::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n\n\\newpage\n\n# Extra Example\n\n## Investigating Speed Limit \n\nSpeed Limit could be considered as a discrete, quantitative variable, but here it might be better to classify it as an (ordinal) qualitative variable.

Why?\n\n- -9 indicates a missing value. Why speed category of <40 **and**  speed limits of 10,15,20,25,30? We could 'clean' the data.\n\nWhat was the most common speed at which a road fatality occurred? How might this affect public policy?\n\n- Notice how many fatalities happen at high speeds (100km/hr+).  \n\n- Can we directly deduce from that lives can be saved by introducing stricter speed limits?\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Clean data \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSpeedLimit[SpeedLimit==\"5\"] = \"<40\"\nSpeedLimit[SpeedLimit==\"10\"] = \"<40\"\nSpeedLimit[SpeedLimit==\"15\"] = \"<40\"\nSpeedLimit[SpeedLimit==\"20\"] = \"<40\"\nSpeedLimit[SpeedLimit==\"25\"] = \"<40\"\nSpeedLimit[SpeedLimit==\"30\"] = \"<40\"\nSpeedLimit[SpeedLimit==-9] = NA\n\nSpeedLimit = factor(SpeedLimit, levels=c(\"<40\",\"40\", \"50\", \"60\", \"70\", \"75\",\n                                         \"80\", \"90\",\"100\",\"110\",\"130\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## New barplot of SpeedLimit\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(table(SpeedLimit))  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Topic00-Introduction_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Double Bar Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Gender = data$Gender\ndata2 = table(Gender,SpeedLimit)\nbarplot(data2[-c(1,4),], main=\"Fatalities by Speed Limit and Gender\",\n  xlab=\"Speed Limit\", col=c(\"lightblue\",\"lightgreen\"),\n \tlegend = rownames(data2[-c(1,4),]), beside=TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Topic00-Introduction_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Statistical Thinking\n\nAre there any interesting patterns?\n\n::::",
