Most of the time, the research question concerns with activities/behaviours/phenomena in a targeted **population**.\n\n::: {style=\"margin-top: -10px\"}\n:::\n\n-   Measurements with respect to the population is always very difficult to obtain, so statisticians aim to answer the research question using a **sample**.\n\n-   A majority of the statistics literature looks at how to ‘best’ infer population characteristics from a sample.\n:::\n\n::::::: thinkingbox\n::: {style=\"margin-top: -10px\"}\n:::\n\nExample: what is the proportion of Australians who are taller than 180\ncm?\n\n::: {style=\"margin-top: -10px\"}\n:::\n\n-   **Solution 1:** Survey all Australians (the population) and\n    calculate the proportion.\n\n::: {style=\"margin-top: -10px\"}\n:::\n\n-   **Solution 2:** Measure the heights of a subset of the population.\n    Build a model based on the observed heights and then answer the\n    question using the model.\n\n::: {style=\"margin-top: -35px\"}\n:::\n::::\n\n# Course overview\n\n::: {style=\"margin-top: -95px\"}\n:::\n\n![](images/img1.png)\n\n::: {style=\"margin-top: -75px\"}\n:::\n\n-   Fundamental statistical concepts.\n-   A number of useful statistical models.\n-   Probability and sampling.\n-   Decision with data.\n-   The R computing language -- for all computational aspects and report\n    written in the course.\n\n# Plan for lectures 1 -- 4\n\n<br>\n\n-   Critical thinking with data\n-   Initial data analysis\n-   Graphical summaries\n-   Numerical summaries\n\n\n## Population and sample\n\n-   The target population comprises all relevant subjects of interest.\n\n-   The sample is a manageable subset, selected to make the study\n    feasible.\n\n![](images/img2.png)\n\n# Population and sample\n\n-   A sample is a subset of the population.\n-   It should be representative of the target population (not\n    **biased**).\n-   Large enough to give accurate information about the population.\n-   Ideally, the observations should be independent of each other.\n\n::: {style=\"margin-top: -60px; text-align: center;\"}\n:::\n\n![](images/img2.png)\n\n# Sources of bias\n\nBias may be defined as any systematic error (ie. not occurring randomly)\nwhich results in incorrect conclusions about the target population. Some\ntypes of bias include\n\n-   Selection bias\n-   Measurement bias\n-   Response bias\n-   Confounding\n\n## Selection bias\n\nSelection bias refers to any systematic differences occurring in the way\nthat subjects are selected for a study.\n\n![](images/img3.png)\n\nE.g. In a height study, we accidentally selected a group of basketball\nplayers.\n\n## Measurement bias\n\nMeasurement bias refers to systematic differences in the measurement of\nvariables.\n\n![](images/img4.png)\n\nE.g. In a human body temperature study, an in-ear thermometer is\nconsistently higher than that of an oral thermometer.\n\n## Response bias\n\n-   Response bias can occur when the response rate to a survey is too\n    low.\n\n-   This is because those who respond to a survey often have different\n    characteristics or attitudes than those who don’t respond.\n\n-   This is most common when sensitive issues are involved.\n\n## Confounding\n\nConfounding occurs when the effect of one variable (X) on another\nvariable (Y) is clouded by the influence of another variable (Z).\n\n![](images/img5.png)\n\nE.g., X: increase in ice cream sales, Y: increase in drowning incidents;\nZ: sunny and warm weather\n\n::: callout-important\nConfounders can be hard to find, and can mislead about a cause and effect relationship.\n:::\n\n# Study design\n\nThere are two main types of study designs\n\nAn **observational study** is one in which there is no treatment imposed\nby the investigator.\n\n-   We simply observe.\n\n-   Data are observed and recorded based on responses from subjects.\n\nAn **experimental study** is one in which the investigator has some\ncontrol over the subjects by giving some kind of treatment.\n\n-   Explanatory variable (determinant) is perturbed, behaviour of\n    dependent variable (response) is noted.\n\n-   Data are observed and recorded based on responses from subjects.\n\n## Study design\n\nConclusions of a study depends on the design. Roughly speaking:\n\n**Observational studies** allow us to infer **association**.\n\n-   We should be very careful about the implications: **association** is\n    not **causation**\n\n-   Confounding variables are always a possible cause of ridiculous\n    conclusions.\n    \n::: callout-example\n- E.g. 3 glasses of water can cure flu. Problem: I take my flu medicine with a glass of water, 3 times day.\n:::\n\n**Experimental studies** allow us to infer causation.\n\n-   Usually more informative on the underlying mechanisms, since the\n    researchers can eliminate external factors in their experiments.\n\n- One must be very familiar with experimental designs and take into account of all sources of variations.\n\n::: callout-example\n- E.g. Crops growth is better in soil with high nitrogen and locations with good sunlight. If an experiment only contains high nitrogen soil and good sunlight, then it is not possible to separate out these two effects.\n:::\n\n## Example: does smoking cause liver cancer?\n\nA study finds that smokers tend to have higher rates of liver cancer.\nDoes smoking cause liver cancer?\n\n![](images/img6.png)\n\n# Association and causation\n\nIt is rather easy to establish association (that one thing is linked to\nanother).\n\n-   Association may **suggest** causation. But association does not\n    **prove** causation.\n-   We need to take **confounding** variables into account. They can\n    mislead about a cause and effect relationship.\n\nWhat could explain the fact that smokers have a higher rate of liver\ncancer?\n\n-   Smokers tend to drink more alcohol than non-smokers, and excessive\n    alcohol consumption causes liver cancer.\n-   So the effect of smoking is confounded (mixed-up) with the effect of\n    alcohol consumption.\n-   Here alcohol consumption is a confounding factor.\n\n## Strategy for establishing causation\n\n-   If a confounder is known, we can potentially add it as an additional\n    variable. For example, if alcohol consumption is a potential\n    confounding factor for smoking's effect on liver cancer, we can add\n    an variable \"drinking\" with possible values:\n    -   \"heavy drinker\", \"medium drinker\", \"light drinker\", \"lifetime\n        abstainer\"\n\n-   In some scenarios, for example, in clinical trials, it is possible\n    to design [**controlled experimental studies**]{.pwd} by\n    manipulating variables to test their effects.\n\n> This presentation is based on the [SOLES reveal.js Quarto template](https://github.com/usyd-soles-edu/soles-revealjs) and is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\nNote that you do **not** need to license your presentation under cc-by 4.0.

To handle this, you can the following:\n\n1.  You **must** have Chrome, or a Chromium-based browser installed.\n2.  Open the HTML output in Chrome.\n3.  Press the `E` key to enter print mode.\n4.  Print to PDF using `ctrl` + `p` (Windows) or `cmd` + `p` (macOS).\n\n# Quick start\n\n## Installing Quarto\n\nQuarto is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. See [installation instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html).\n\n### Recommendation\n\n[**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended as the editor for Quarto. It is free, open-source, and has a lot of extensions that can be used to enhance the writing experience.\n\n### However...\n\nUsers familiar with [RStudio](https://posit.co/) can also use it to write Quarto documents. See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) for more information.\n\n## Installing this template\n\nThere are three (3) ways:\n\n::: fragment\n### 1. Recommended: Use the Quarto CLI\n\nWith the [**Quarto CLI**](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html#installing-the-quarto-cli) installed, run the following command in your terminal and follow the instructions:\n\n``` sh\nquarto use template usyd-soles-edu/soles-revealjs\n```\n:::\n\n::: fragment\n### 2. Download the template directly\n\nYou can download the template folder directly from GitHub, ready to use. Go to the [repository](https://github.com/usyd-soles-edu/soles-revealjs) and click on \"\\< \\> Code\", then \"Download ZIP\". Once you unzip the folder.\n:::\n\n::: fragment\n### 3. Clone the template repository\n\nGo to the [repository](https://github.com/usyd-soles-edu/soles-revealjs) and click on \"Use this template\". Note that you will need to be familiar with Git and GitHub to use this method.\n:::\n\n## Editing the template\n\nAll written content is in the `template.qmd` file. You may rename this file to whatever you like.\n\n### HTML output\n\nSlides that are generated from this template are in HTML format. You can view the slides by opening the `.html` file in your browser. This file is generated in the same folder as the `.qmd` file.\n\n### Options\n\nEdit the `_quarto.yml` file to override the default options. For example, you can enable or disable the table of contents, change the theme, and more. You will need to know about [Quarto project basics](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html)to do this.\n\n## Markdown\n\n### Flavour\n\nQuarto uses [**Pandoc-flavoured Markdown**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) for text formatting.\n\n### Formatting\n\n**Bold** and *italic*. `Inline code`. What about a [link](https://quarto.org)? And a footnote[^1]? We can also use subscript~s~ and superscript^s^.\n\n[^1]: This is a footnote.\n\n### Lists\n\n-   Lists **must** be preceded by a blank line.\n-   We can also created nested lists:\n    1.  This list is ordered.\n        -   Next item in the list, nested and back to unordered.\n\n# Advanced features\n\n## Reproducible workflows\n\nThe advantage of Quarto over traditional slide software is that it allows code and output to be embedded in the document. This means that you can create a document that is **reproducible** and **versioned**.\n\nFor example, the source of this slide is in the `template.qmd` file.\n\n## Code example 1\n\nUsing R, we show how to fit a linear regression model and print the model summary.

For example, the equation $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon$ is a linear regression model.\n\n### Display equations\n\nDisplay equations are surrounded by `$$`. For example, one way to display the equation for a [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series) is:\n\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ a_n \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n x}{L} \\right) + b_n \\sin \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n x}{L} \\right) \\right] $$\n\n## Callout blocks\n\n::: callout-note\nCallout blocks are a way to draw attention to important points.
