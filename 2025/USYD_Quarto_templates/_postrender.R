# This script automatically detects whether the user is on a Windows or Mac OS
# and if so, it will search for an html file in the current directory and
# convert it to a pdf file with the same name. Requires the chromote and
# renderthis packages to be installed, which are most likely already installed
# if you are using the renv package and you have run either `renv::restore()` or
# `renv::snapshot()`.

# Yuu can run this script postrender in Quarto by uncommenting the postrender
# line in the _quarto.yml file, but it will add about 10 seconds to the render
# time.
