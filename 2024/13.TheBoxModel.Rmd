# The Box model


## Statistical models
- A **model** is a representation of something which 
  - is **simpler** but at the same time
  - captures the **key features** of the original.
  
- Data obtained "in real life" is generated (in general) by quite complicated processes.

- **Statistical models** are models for data-generating processes:
  - they are much simpler than the "real" data-generating process but
  - (hopefully) they capture the key features, at least in terms of the **random variability** of the data.

## The box model
- The **box model** is a very simple statistical model for *numerical* data.
- A collection of $N$ objects, e.g. tickets, balls is imagined "in a box".
- Each object bears a number.
- A **random sample** of a certain number of the objects is taken.
- The sampling may be **with** or **without** replacement.

## Random samples
- What does "a random sample is taken" mean exactly?
- It means that: 


<div class="thinkingbox"> 
A sample of the appropriate size is taken in such a way that
 **each possible sample** is equally likely.
</div>

## Single observations (samples of size $n=1$)

- If a single draw is taken, then each object in the "box" has an equal chance of being picked.
- If we *completely know* the contents of the box, we can write down the chance of each possible value.


## Simple Examples
- For example, suppose we have the following (simple) box:
  \[\fbox{ $\fbox{1}\ \fbox{2}\ \fbox{3}$ }\]
- There are then three possible values: $\fbox{1}$, $\fbox{2}$ and $\fbox{3}$ and each has (equal) chance of $\frac13$ of being picked:
  \[ P(\text{drawing $\fbox{1}$}) =
   P(\text{drawing $\fbox{2}$}) =
   P(\text{drawing $\fbox{3}$}) = \frac13\,.\]
  Here we write $P(\cdot)$ to denote the "probability" or "chance" of each event.
  
## Non-equal chances
- We can have box models where the different possible *values* are not necessarily equally likely.
- For the box 
  \[\fbox{ $\fbox{1}\ \fbox{2}\ \fbox{2}\  \fbox{3}\ \fbox{3}\ \fbox{3}$ }\]
  if each "ticket" is equally likely,  we have
  \[ P(\text{drawing $\fbox{1}$}) = \frac16\,,\]
  \[ P(\text{drawing $\fbox{2}$}) = \frac26 = \frac13\,,\]
  \[  P(\text{drawing $\fbox{3}$}) = \frac36 = \frac12\,.\]

## Larger box example
Consider the box defined by the file `y.dat` in the R code below:
```{r}
y = scan("y.dat")
y
```
What is the chance that a single draw from this is less than 8?

## Find the *proportion* less than 8
```{r}
table(y)
sum(table(y))
```

```{r}
length(y)
sum(y<8)
```

## _
```{r}
sum(y<8)/length(y)
mean(y<8)
```
The chance of drawing a value less than 8 is $\frac{35}{216}\approx 16\%$. 

## More complicated examples: summaries of boxes
- For box models with a large number of "tickets" we may not know the "exact" composition of the box.
- We may have a *summary* of the list of numbers on the tickets, e.g. histogram.
  - We can then provide *approximations* to the chances of certain events.
  
## Histogram example
Suppose we only had access to the following histogram of `y`, and wanted to approximate the chance of 
drawing a number less than 8:
```{r}
hist(y, pr=T)
```

## Area of rectangles
- The *area* of each rectangle gives the proportion/percentage of values in that range.
- The heights of the rectangles (from the left) are (approx.) 0.009, 0.037, 0.083. 
- Since the bases are 2 units wide, the (approx.) area of the first 3 rectangles is
  $$0.018 + 0.074 + 0.166 \approx 26\%$$
- This is an overestimate because the rectangle includes the right endpoint of each interval in R by default. 
- It actually gives a better estimate of the chance of a draw being $\leq 8$, so compare this to
```{r}
mean(y<=8)
```

  

## Normal approximation to histograms and chances
- Suppose  that for a  box model with a large number of tickets,  the histogram of the list of numbers is "bell-shaped".
- Then all we need to approximate
  - certain areas under the histogram boxes and thus
  - certain chances/probabilities
  
  is the mean $\mu$  and SD  $\sigma$ of the list of numbers in the box.
  
## Normal approximation example 
- Suppose we are told that the mean and SD of `y` are `10.5` and `2.96` (resp.), and that it is "bell-shaped". 
- How now to approximate the chance of a draw less than 8?
- In standard units, 8 corresponds to
```{r}
(8-10.5)/2.96
```
- The tail area below this point on the standard normal curve is
```{r}
pnorm(-.8446)
```
 

## New interpretation of mean and SD of box
- When we are taking a random numerical draw from a box, we shall see that the mean and SD of the box
have a new, special interpretation.
- We call the mean $\mu$ of the box the **expected value (EV)** of the draw.
- We call the SD $\sigma$ of the box the **standard error (SE)** of the random draw.

## Random draw =  Expected value + Chance error
- The random draw may be "decomposed" into two pieces:
$$\text{Random draw} = \text{EV} + \text{(Random draw $-$ EV)} = \text{EV} + \text{Chance error}\,.$$
- The first part EV is *not random*. 
  - All randomness is included in the chance error, which is itself a random draw from an **error box** (a box with mean zero).
- **Example**: a random draw from  $$\fbox{ $\fbox{1}\ \fbox{2}\ \fbox{3}$ }$$
  may instead be thought of as 
  $$2 + \text{ Random draw from the error box }
  \fbox{ $\fbox{$-1$}\ \fbox{0}\ \fbox{+1}$ }$$

## Standard error
- The **standard error** is the "root-mean-square" of the error box.
  - Measures the "size" of the errors in some sense.
- It is a measure of "random variation".
- For two different random draws, one with the larger SE is likely to differ from its
  EV by a larger amount.
  
## Samples of size $n\geq 2$: Example
- Consider our earlier example with the box
  $$\fbox{ $\fbox{1}\ \ \fbox{2}\ \  \fbox{3}$  }$$
  and that we wish to take a random sample of size $n=2$.
- This means *each possible sample of size 2 is equally likely*.
- We can list all possible samples (there are $9 = 3^2$ of them):
$$
\left(\fbox{1}, \fbox{1}\right), 
\left(\fbox{1}, \fbox{2}\right), 
\left(\fbox{1}, \fbox{3}\right),$$ 
$$ \left(\fbox{2}, \fbox{1}\right), 
\left(\fbox{2}, \fbox{2}\right), 
\left(\fbox{2}, \fbox{3}\right),$$ 
$$\left(\fbox{3}, \fbox{1}\right), 
\left(\fbox{3}, \fbox{2}\right), 
\left(\fbox{3}, \fbox{3}\right).$$ 

## Statistic of interest: sample sum
- When we take a sample of size $n\geq 2$, we are often interested in a single numerical characteristic (a "statistic") of the sample.
- We shall discuss what happens when we are interested in the **sample sum**.
- Note that each *equally likely* sample has a corresponding sum.
- Thus the two-step process of

  1. taking a sample and then
  2. computing the sum
  
  may be thought of as equivalent to taking a **single draw from a "bigger" box** (the box of sums of all possible samples)

## Table of all possible samples and their sums

Sample | Sum
-------|-----
 (1,1) | 2 
 (1,2) | 3  
 (1,3) | 4 
 (2,1) | 3 
 (2,2) | 4  
 (2,3) | 5 
 (3,1) | 4 
 (3,2) | 5  
 (3,3) | 6 

## Equivalent single-draw (bigger) box
Thus, the two-step process of:

1. taking a random sample of size $n=2$ from the box
   \[\fbox{ $\fbox{1}\ \fbox{2}\ \fbox{3}$ }\]
2. getting the sum
  
is equivalent to taking a **single random draw** from the box
  \[\fbox{ $\fbox{2}\ \fbox{3}\ \fbox{3}\ \fbox{4}\ \fbox{4}\ \fbox{4}\ \fbox{5}\ \fbox{5}\ \fbox{6} $ }\]
  
## EV and SE of the sum
In our last example, note that
- the original box (the "population")
  \[\fbox{ $\fbox{1}\ \fbox{2}\ \fbox{3}$ }\]
  has mean $\mu=2$, mean square $(1+4+9)/3 = 14/3$ and thus SD
  $$ \sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{14}3 - 2^2}= \sqrt{\frac{14 - 12}3} = \sqrt{\frac23}\,.$$

(Recall the useful computing formula SD = $\sqrt{\text{ mean square} - (\text{average})^2       }$)

## Box of all possible sums: mean and SD
The box of all possible sums though, has mean
$$ \frac{2 + 3 + 3+ 4+4+4+5+5+6}9 = \frac{36}9= 4 = 2\mu\,,$$
mean square 
$$ \frac{4+9+9+16+16+16+25+25+36}9 = \frac{156}9$$
and thus SD
$$ \sqrt{\frac{156}9 - 4^2} = \sqrt{\frac{156 - (9\times 16)}9} = \sqrt{\frac{156 - 144}9} 
=\sqrt{\frac 43} = \frac 2{\sqrt 3} = \sqrt 2 \sigma\,.$$


## General result for sums

This is a special case  of an important special result.

<div class="thinkingbox"> 
- Suppose a random sample of size $n$ is taken *with replacement* from a box with mean $\mu$ and SD $\sigma$. 
- Then the sample sum has expected value $n \mu$ and standard error $\sqrt n \sigma$.
</div>

This follows because 

- the bigger box of sums of all possible samples has mean $n\mu$ and SD $\sqrt n \sigma$;
- taking a sample and computing the sum is equivalent to a single random draw from this bigger box.
