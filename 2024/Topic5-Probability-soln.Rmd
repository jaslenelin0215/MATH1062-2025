A coin is tossed twice. If the coin lands heads on the 2nd toss, you win $1.

- If the 1st coin is a head, what is the chance of winning $1? 
- If the 1st coin is a tail, what is the chance of winning $1? 
- Are the tosses independent? 
- What is the chance of winning $1?

<div style="margin-top: -30px"></div>

1. Event HH out of {HH,HT}; P(2nd H| 1st H) = $\frac{1}{2}$.
2. Event TH out of {TH,TT}; P(2nd H| 1st T) = $\frac{1}{2}$. 
3. Yes. 
4. $\frac{1}{2}$ regardless of the first event.

A die is rolled twice. What is chance that:

- both the 1st and 2nd rolls are 1s?
- the 1st roll is a 1 or the 2nd roll is a 1?


<div style="margin-top: -30px"></div>

</div>
<br>

Two rolls are independent.

1. P(1st roll is 1) $\times$ P(2nd roll is 1 | 1st roll is 1) = $\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$ 
2. P(1st roll is 1) + P(2nd roll is 1) - P(1st roll is 1 and 2nd roll is 1) = $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{36} = \frac{11}{36}$

<div style="margin-top: 10px"></div>

A standard deck of 52 playing cards, consisting of 13 cards of each suit (four suits). A deck of cards is shuffled.

What is chance that:

- both the top card and the bottom card are the ace of spades?
- the top card is the ace of spades or the bottom card is the ace of spades?

<div style="margin-top: -30px"></div>

</div>
<br>

1. 0 as they are mutually exclusive.
2. P(top card is the ace of spades) + P(bottom card is the ace of spades) - P(top card and the bottom card are the ace of spades) 
= $\frac{1}{52} + \frac{1}{52} - 0 = \frac{2}{52} = \frac{1}{26}$

Why did the Chevalier lose money? What is the chance of winning? 

  - Game A: Roll a die 4 times. Win = at least 1 "ace". 
  - Game B: Roll a pair of dice 24 times: Win = at least 1 "double-ace".
  - Note: an "ace" means "1".

<div style="margin-top: -30px"></div>

</div>

##

|Game|1 roll| # rolls|P(no Win)|P(Win)|
|-|---|-|---|---|
|A|P(not Ace) = 5/6|4|P(no Aces) = (5/6)^4 |1-(5/6)^4 = 0.518|
|B|P(not Double-Ace) = 35/36|24|P(no Double-Aces) = (35/36)^24|1-(35/36)^24=0.49|

<br>

- Not having an "ace" in each roll is independent, applying the multiplication rule to work out the chance of lossing.

- Considering the **complement** event, makes each of the complements **mutually exclusive**, so the solution follows easily.

- So it's slightly better to play Game A.

<div style="margin-top: 10px"></div>

A chain is formed from n independent links, with a probability of $\theta$ that any link fails under a specified load. What is the probability that the chain fails under the load?

<div style="margin-top: -30px"></div>

</div>

<div style="margin-top: 30px"></div>

- A link does not fail is mutually exclusive to a link fails, so 
\[
P(\text{a link does not fail}) = 1- \theta
\]

- A chain fails is is mutually exclusive to a chain does not fail, so
\[
P(\text{a chain fails}) = 1 - P(\text{a chain does not fail}) = 1 - P(\text{all $n$ links do not fail})
\]

- $P(\text{all $n$ links do not fail}) = (1-\theta)^n$

- $P(\text{a chain fails}) = 1 - (1-\theta)^n$.

<div style="margin-top: 10px"></div>

The probability that a component lasts at least $x$ hours is $e^{−x/100}$ , for $x > 0$. What is the probability that the component lasts at least 10 hours, given it has already lasted at least 6 hours?

<div style="margin-top: -30px"></div>

</div>

<div style="margin-top: 30px"></div>

We denote the event of a component lasting at least $x$ hours by $T \geq x$. This way, the probability we are looking at is the conditional probability
\[
P(T \geq 10 | T \geq 6) = \frac{P(T \geq 6 \cap T \geq 10)}{P(T \geq 6)} = \frac{P(T \geq 10)}{P(T \geq 6)} = e^{-4/100}
\]
