# Basic concepts

## Lecture 1 (Week 1)

### Causation and association

- It is very difficult to establish causation

- It is rather easy to establish association (that one thing is linked
    to another).
    -   Association may **suggest** causation.
    -   But association does not **prove** causation.

### Confounding

- It occurs when the effect of one variable (X) on another variable (Y) is clouded by the influence of another variable (Z).

- A confounding variable can lead to **Simpson's Paradox**: the association between a pair of variables (X,Y) reverses sign upon conditioning of a third variable Z, regardless of the value taken by Z.

# Graphical summaries

## Lectures 1 and 2 (Week 1)

### Barplots 
- for qualitative variables

### Histogram 
- for quantitative variables
- density scale vs. frequency scale
- endpoint convention of class intervals
- the height and area of each block of a (density-scale) histogram respectively represent the density and proportion of a class interval
  
## Lectures 1 and 2 (Week 1)

### Scatter plot 
- for a pair of quantitative variables, used in [linear models](#14)

### Box plot 
- for quantitative variables, constructed from the median and the quartile range, see [numerical summaries](#9)
- can locate outliers on a box plot

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=8,echo=F}
par(mar=c(0, 0, 0, 0))
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width, horizontal = T, frame.plot = FALSE, xaxt='n', ann=FALSE)
```


# Numerical summaries

## Center, Lecture 3 (Week 2)

### Sample mean 
- sample average

### Sample median 
- middle point of a set of data values based on ordering

### Skewness 
- can be determined by sample mean and sample median

### Robustness 
- the median is robust to outliers 

## Spread, Lecture 4 (Week 3)

### Standard deviation (SD)
  - Sample standard deviation (divided by $n-1$) 
  - Population standard deviation (divided by $n$)
  - Standard unit (Z-score) $$standard\;units = \frac{data\;points - mean}{SD}$$

### Quantiles 
  - Interquatile range (IQR, the range of the middle 50% of data)
  - Being able to relate median and IQR to a box plot

# Normal curve 

## Lecture 5 (Week 3)
A simple model used for approximate the data distribution (using [mean](#10) and [SD](#11)) 

### Applications
- Understand how to calculate proportions of a population, e.g., $P[X \leq x_0]$ or $P[x_0 \leq X \leq x_1]$, using area under the normal curve 
- Basic R commands for calculating these areas and the quantiles

### Useful properties
- Any general normal can be rescaled into the standard normal
- Symmetry around the mean
- The 68%-95%-99.7% rule (areas 1, 2, and 3 SDs out from the mean in both directions)

# Linear model

## Lecture 6 (Week 4) 

### Scatter plot 
- Being able to describe the association between a pair of quantitative variables based on a scatter plot 

### Correlation coefficient ($r$)
- Understand the definition (average of the products of Z scores)
- Its value is always beween $-1$ and $1$
- Being able to interpret linear association using the values of correlation coefficient (and vice versa)
- Properties: it is symmetric and invariant to scaling and shift
- Can be sensitive to outliers
- Nonlinear association cannot be determined (thinking about the Anscombes Quartet)


## Lecture 7 (Week 5)

### Regression Line
- Use five numerical summaries $\bar x, \bar y, SD_x, SD_y$ and $r$
- The line connects $(\bar x, \bar y)$ and $(\bar x + SD_x, \bar y + r SD_y)$, also takes the form (`lm()`) $$y = Intercept + slope \times x$$
- Coefficient of determination ($r^2$), which tells the proportion of the variation (compared to the baseline prediction) in the dependent variable that can be explained by the linear model 
- Residual plot
  - If the linear fit is appropriate for the data, it should show no pattern (random points around 0)
  - By checking the patterns of the residuals, the residual plot is a diagnostic plot to check the appropriateness of a linear model
  - Homogeneity of the spread (homoscedasticity or heteroscedasticity)
  
  
# Chance 

## Lecture 8 (Week 5) 

### Addition and multiplication rule

|What|When|Formula|Condition|
|---|----|-------|-----|
Addition Rule| P(At least 1 of 2 events occurs)| P(Event1) + P(Event2) - P(Both events occur) | always|
|||    P(Event1) + P(Event2)|   if mutually exclusive  |
Multiplication Rule| P(Both events occur)| P(Event1) x P($\mbox{Event2|Event1}$)| always|
||| P(Event1) x P(Event2)| if independent |


### Conditional probability P(Event 2 | Event 1)
- the chance that a certain event (2) occurs, *given* another event (1) has occurred.

### Application of these rules 
- Being able to work out probability of a combination of events, e.g., Chevalier's gambling games


## Lecture 9 (Week 6)



### Factorial and combinations
- Factorial counts the number of **ordered** arrangements and combination is **not** sensitive to ordering
- Useful in counting the number of possible outcomes in ``classical'' probability

### Chance simulation 
- Counting and drawing trees 
- Using R
- Sample with and without replacement: with replacement implies independence
